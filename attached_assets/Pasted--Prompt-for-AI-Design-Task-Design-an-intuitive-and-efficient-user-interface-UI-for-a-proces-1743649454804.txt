**Prompt for AI Design Task:**

Design an intuitive and efficient user interface (UI) for a process planning software that incorporates an interactive chat system and comprehensive statistical dashboards. The UI should prioritize usability, accessibility, and effective data visualization while integrating the following features:

1. **Interactive Chat System:**
   - Enable private and group messaging functionalities.
   - Facilitate meeting scheduling and room allocation.
   - Implement tagged notifications for user mentions in conversations.
   - Include message prioritization options, allowing users to flag messages as urgent or important.
   - Integrate a smart search functionality to quickly locate past conversations and critical information.

2. **Statistical Dashboards:**
   - Create visual representations for key metrics, including:
     - **Pending Work Tracker:** 
       - Use a bar chart or pie chart to display pending tasks categorized by priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
     - **Performance Improvement Analysis:** 
       - Develop a line chart to track individual performance trends over time, considering metrics like task completion rates, efficiency, or feedback scores.
     - **Completed Work Overview:** 
       - Design a stacked bar chart visualizing completed tasks categorized by project or task types (e.g., Bugs Fixed, Features Developed, Documents Completed).
     - **Notifications Dashboard:** 
       - Categorize notifications (Mentions, Meeting Reminders, Deadlines, Project Updates) using a donut chart or a timeline chart.
     - **Workload Distribution Analysis:** 
       - Implement a heatmap to visualize workload distribution across teams and time periods to identify overworked employees and optimize resource allocation.
     - **Project Success and Failure Analytics:** 
       - Use comparative bar charts to illustrate success and failure rates of different projects, providing insights for root cause analysis to enhance project management strategies.

3. **Accessibility Features:**
   - Include options for dark mode, font size adjustments, screen reader support, and keyboard shortcuts to ensure the UI is user-friendly for all individuals.
